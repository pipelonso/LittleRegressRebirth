                    Hello
===============================================
littleRegress is a project made with de purpose to give to regresionist Minecraft community a complete new experience into Minecraft,I am very grateful for all the support that the project has received, that is why I constantly update it. I have made an effort to make it easy to install and configure since it is intended for everyone. I have also strived to provide security for users based on what they want to experience in their gaming experience using the datapack, Every day the datapack becomes more user-friendly and better with each update, adding more than 30 new things to the game.
Due to a recent snapshot close to the current date 04-12-24 the datapack will not be able to be updated to new versions, The syntax of the commands has been completely changed, making the datapack content incompatible for future versions. 
But that doesn't mean there won't be a datapack for future Minecraft releases, I'm excited to see what can be done with the new commands, and the datapack will be remade from scratch for future Minecraft releases.
I will try to leave a final and stable version of the datapack for this version, before starting development for future versions of Minecraft.
I'm excited to remake this in a better way with more powerful commands.
See you in a while.
